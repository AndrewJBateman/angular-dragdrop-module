# AngularDragdropModule

This project uses the Angular 7 Component Dev Kit (cdk) Drag and Drop module to drag numbered boxes from a list on the left to a numbered list on the right and vice versa. [Angular documentation on observables](https://angular.io/guide/observables)

It was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.6.


## Notes

"The @angular/cdk/drag-drop module provides you with a way to easily and declaratively create drag-and-drop interfaces, with support for free dragging, sorting within a list, transferring items between lists, animations, touch devices, custom drag handles, previews, and placeholders, in addition to horizontal lists and locking along an axis."
